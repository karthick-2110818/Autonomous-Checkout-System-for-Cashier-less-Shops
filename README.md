AUTONOMOUS CHECKOUT SYSTEM

The Autonomous Checkout System aims to transform the retail experience by eliminating manual barcode scanning. It uses computer vision to automatically recognize products, enabling a seamless and contactless checkout process.
It also incorporates real-time freshness detection for perishable items like fruits and vegetables, ensuring that only high-quality produce is sold, which enhances both product quality and customer trust.
This system meets the growing demand for faster, more accurate checkouts, reducing human error and improving operational efficiency, while delivering a superior shopping experience.
